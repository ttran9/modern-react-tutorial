# Some Information

    - I will be following this [a react tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d).
    - I am starting this repository up to the end of the third video.

# Video Note(s) (if applicable):

    - Video 7:
        - When we wrap the handleClickAgain function inside of an anonymous function it will not be called right away.
        - When we reference a function we automatically get the event object.

    - Video 8:
        - useState hook allows component to be reactive and will trigger a re-rendering of the component.

    - Video 9:
        - likely no code changes because this video just discusses React Developer Tools.
